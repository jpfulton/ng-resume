when we passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device; 
and from third parties.
</p>

<h3>

We will collect any information you provide to us. We may collect information from you 
in a variety of ways, such as when you: (a) create an online account,

<h3>
Information that Is Automatically Collected
</h3>

<h4>
Device/Usage Information
</h4>

<p>
We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices 
(including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access the Services. 
As described further below, we may collect and analyze (a) device information 
such as IP addresses, location information (by country and city), 
unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, browser types, 
browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, 
and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, 
such as referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, 
domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, 
statistical information about the use of the Services, the amount of time spent 
on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of 
your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information. As described 
further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including 
cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.
</p>

<h4>
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
</h4>

<p>
We also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server 
logs and online tracking technologies, like cookies and/or tracking pixels. 
A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small 
text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us 
to: (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and settings; 
(c) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited and the referral 
sites that have led you to our Services; (d) enhance your user experience by 
delivering content  specific to your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and 
analytics; and (f) assist with security administrative functions. 
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny 
electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, 
and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, 
measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. 
We may also use tracking technologies in our license buttons and/or icons that you can 
embed on other sites/services to track the website addresses where they are embedded, 
gauge user interaction with them, and determine the number of unique viewers of them. 
If you receive email from us (such as the CC newsletter, campaign updates, or 
other ongoing email communications from CC), we may use certain analytics tools, 
such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, 
click on any links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. 
This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing 
campaigns.  As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional 
information through other methods.
</p>

<p>
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being 
set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” 
section of your browser for more information. Please note that by blocking 
any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

provide services to our users.

International Transfers
</h2>

<p>
As described above in the “When We Disclose Your Information” section, 
we may share your information with trusted service providers or business 
partners in countries other than your country of residence in accordance

in countries that may not offer the same level of protection as the privacy laws

<p>
If we provide any information about you to any third parties information

to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance 
with this Privacy Policy and other data protection laws to govern the 
transfers of such data.
</p>

<h2>
Security Measures
</h2>

<p>
We have implemented technical, physical, and organizational security 
measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of your information. 
These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. 
However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent 
every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since 
despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.
