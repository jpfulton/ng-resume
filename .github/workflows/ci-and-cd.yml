# Define environment variables available to all jobs and steps.
#
# To allow for finer grained control of the Angular build process, these variables (which
# are used in the Azure/static-web-apps-deploy module) are configured as though the client
# application to deploy is a simple HTML application. Following the initial steps in the
# lint_test_build_deploy_job, the build output from the 'ng build' command are placed
# in the /ng-resume/dist/ng-resume folder as completed build output artifacts and may be pushed to Azure
# as though they are a "static HTML site" in the eyes of the deploy step.
#
# Reference for framework deploy configurations: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks
